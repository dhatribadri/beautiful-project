## Introduction

•	Crayfish are cool – here’s why: give a brief introduction as to what they are, where they found, who they are related to (closest ancestor maybe?), phylogenetic analysis 

•	Talk about crayfish in Arkansas (specific to geographic region)

•	Introduce hypothesis: COX 1 sanger sequences collected from Arkansas 
- Propose that this appearance of crayfish (talk about the cypress swamps) hasn’t been documented or discovered yet --> new species maybe?? 

•	Detailed analysis of crayfish in Arkansas documented int his paper and will be used as reference sequences (Robison et al., 2017)

•	Talk about the variability of COX 1 in intra-species of Crayfish (Bentley et al., 2010) and (Taylor et al., 2002)
